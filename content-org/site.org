** Directory Structure
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: directory-structure
:END:
Set up your project with this structure:

#+begin_example
my-website/
├── hugo-site/                 # Hugo site directory
│   ├── content/
│   ├── static/

│   └── website.org           # Your main org file
└── scripts/                  # Optional build scripts
#+end_example

** Hugo Configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hugo-configuration
:END:
In your =hugo-site/config.yaml=, ensure you have:

#+begin_src yaml
baseURL: 'https://yourdomain.com'  # Change for production
languageCode: 'en-us'
title: 'Daniel Tregeagle'
theme: 'your-theme-name'

# Useful for development
canonifyURLs: true
relativeURLs: true  # Helpful for local testing
#+end_src

** Org-mode Configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-mode-configuration
:END:
Update your org file header:

#+begin_src org
,#+title: Daniel Tregeagle Website
,#+author: Daniel Tregeagle
,#+hugo_base_dir: ../hugo-site/    # Point to your Hugo directory
,#+hugo_section: .                 # Export to content root
#+end_src

** Local Development Workflow
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: local-development-workflow
:END:
*** 1. Export from Org-mode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: export-from-org-mode
:END:
In Emacs, with your org file open: - =C-c C-e H H= (export current
subtree) or - =C-c C-e H A= (export all subtrees)

This will generate markdown files in =hugo-site/content/=

*** 2. Start Hugo Development Server
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: start-hugo-development-server
:END:
Open PowerShell or Command Prompt in your =hugo-site= directory:

#+begin_src powershell
# Navigate to Hugo site directory
cd path\to\your\hugo-site

# Start development server
hugo server -D --bind 0.0.0.0

# Alternative with specific port
hugo server -D -p 1313
#+end_src

*Key flags:* - =-D= includes draft content - =--bind 0.0.0.0= allows
access from other devices on network - =-p 1313= specifies port (1313 is
default)

*** 3. View Your Site
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: view-your-site
:END:
Open browser to: =http://localhost:1313=

The server will automatically reload when you make changes!

** File Management
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: file-management
:END:
*** Static Files (PDFs, Images)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: static-files-pdfs-images
:END:
Place your files in =hugo-site/static/=:

#+begin_example
hugo-site/static/
├── files/
│   ├── tregeagleCV_2021_07.pdf
│   └── dissertationFinal.pdf
└── photos/
    └── danielTregeaglePicture2.JPG
#+end_example

Links in org-mode should reference them as =/files/filename.pdf=

*** Handling Files with Spaces
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: handling-files-with-spaces
:END:
*Option 1: Rename files (recommended)*

#+begin_src powershell
# In your static/files directory
ren "Wei et al. - Estimated Cost of the Withdrawal of the Insecticid.pdf" "Wei_et_al_Estimated_Cost_Withdrawal_Insecticide.pdf"
#+end_src

*Option 2: URL encoding (if renaming isn't possible)* Files with spaces
work but may cause issues. Hugo generally handles them, but it's cleaner
to rename.

** Build for Production
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: build-for-production
:END:
When ready to deploy:

#+begin_src powershell
# Clean previous build
hugo --cleanDestinationDir

# Build for production

If Hugo server shows errors:

#+begin_src powershell
# Run with verbose output
hugo server -D --verbose

# Check Hugo version
hugo version
#+end_src

*** 4. Theme Considerations
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: theme-considerations
:END:
If using a theme, ensure your content structure matches theme
expectations. Some themes expect specific front matter or file
organization.

** Windows-Specific Notes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: windows-specific-notes
:END:
- Use PowerShell or Command Prompt for Hugo commands
- File paths use backslashes (=\=) in Windows, but Hugo handles both
- Consider using Windows Terminal for better command-line experience
- Git Bash also works well if you prefer Unix-style commands

In this Winter 2021 installment of the NC State Economist, Dr. Daniel Tregeagle highlights the impacts of Covid-19 on North Carolina's specialty crop producers and markets. He also reveals the results of a recent survey of caneberry growers on the trends, challenges and opportunities in their specialty crop sector.

*** [[/files/Wei et al. - Estimated Cost of the Withdrawal of the Insecticid.pdf][Estimated Cost of the Withdrawal of the Insecticide Chlorpyrifos for Six Major California Crops]]

In May 2019, the CA Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) initiated the cancellation of the pesticide chlorpyrifos. This article estimates the economic effects of cancellation on six major California crops. Statewide annual revenue losses are estimated at $11.5 million, averaged across acreage and pesticide use for three base years (2015–2017): $1.6 million for alfalfa, $0.6 million for almonds, $1 million for citrus, $7.1 million for cotton, $4.3 million for grapes, and $3.2 million for walnuts. In addition, gross revenue losses due to reduced cotton yields are estimated to be $6.3 million. Importantly, estimated losses are for only six crops. The total cost to California agriculture will be greater.

*** [[/files/Tregeagle_Zilberman_2018_Implications of Disrupting a Perennial Crop Replanting Cycle.pdf][Implications of Disrupting a Perennial Crop Replanting Cycle: The Brazilian Sugarcane Example]]

Brazilian sugarcane yields declined sharply in 2011, ending a decade-long expansion of the industry. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, credit-constrained farmers replanted fewer sugarcane fields, leading to an increase in the average age of canes and a decline in yield several years later. Had average age remained constant over this period, industry revenues would have been around 10% higher in 2011 and 2012. This example shows how interruptions to the regular replanting schedules of a perennial crop can have production effects years into the future.

*** [[/files/Blecker et al (2018) - Economic Value of the Herbicide Dacthal for Brassica and Allium Crops in.pdf][Economic Value of the Herbicide Dacthal for Brassica and Allium Crops in California]]

California review of the herbicide dacthal triggered by the requirements of California's Pesticide Contamination Prevention Act was conducted in 2018. This article estimates the economic effects a cancellation of dacthal's California registration would have on brassica and allium crops. Statewide net revenue losses for broccoli, dry onion, and cabbage, the largest users of dacthal, are estimated at $25.4 million: $17.9 million for broccoli, $2.4 million for cabbage, and $5.1 million for onion.

#+end_comment

I am an assistant professor and extension specialist in the [[https://cals.ncsu.edu/agricultural-and-resource-economics][Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at North Carolina State University]]. My work is focused on the economics of specialty crops and the economics of agricultural policy more generally. Applications have included analyzing agro-environmental policy, market analysis, minimizing costs of processing supply chains, and optimizing orchard replacement.

I hold a Ph.D. and M.S. in agricultural and resource economics from the [[https://are.berkeley.edu][University of California, Berkeley]] as well as a Bachelor of Resource Economics (Hons. 1M) from the [[http://sydney.edu.au][University of Sydney, Australia]]. During my postdoctoral studies at the [[https://are.ucdavis.edu][Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Davis]], I co-authored several inter-disciplinary reports for the California Department of Food and Agriculture analyzing the expected impacts of proposed pesticide regulations.

My primary fields of study are agricultural, environmental, and natural resource economics.

/Abstract:/
Pesticide resistance poses an increasing challenge for agricultural sustainability. Pesticide susceptibility is a depletable biological resource, but resistance management rarely quantifies marginal, forward-looking economic costs to users of depleting this resource. We use a generic stochastic bioeconomic model of pesticide resistance evolution in a crop pest population, stochastic dynamic programming, and global sensitivity analysis to analyze the 'marginal user costs' of resistance. The most impactful parameters on these costs are population density dependence and pesticide prices. Least impactful is the fitness cost of resistance, which is noteworthy because of prior emphasis on this parameter in the resistance management literature.

/Outstanding Published Paper which Significantly Contributed to the SCE Discipline, Specialty Crop Economics Section, Agricultural and Applied Economics Association, 2024./

/Abstract:/
Perennial crops are important both economically and as a component of a healthy and nutritious diet (e.g., many fruits and nuts). However, the study of perennial crop production and farmer response to output price changes (i.e., supply response) is complex thanks to the dynamic nature of investment and decision making in these industries. The body of literature relevant to perennial crop supply response is also small relative to that of annual commodity crops. In this article, we contribute the first literature review on perennial crop supply response modeling in more than 30 years. We catalog advancements in estimating perennial crop supply response and discuss the application of these methods and trade-offs economists should be aware of when using them. In addition, we highlight future modeling developments that may be valuable to the field, with the hope this research will encourage additional economic research on this interesting and important topic and in turn provide new insights for perennial crop producers and policymakers.

(with David Zilberman) - /Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics/, 2023, 55(2), 376--398.

/Abstract:/
We develop and analyze an unexplored mechanism to reduce biorefinery supply chain costs when the feedstock is a perennial crop: adjusting the age structure, and hence yield, of the perennial feedstock. The non-monotonicity of the age-yield function introduces a non-convexity to the cost minimization problem. We show that, despite this, the problem has a solution and present analytic and numeric comparative statics, finding that larger refineries are most likely to benefit from optimizing age structure. The model is calibrated to the sugarcane industry in Brazil. The cost reductions from optimizing age, compared to the observed regional average age, are less than 1%.

(with Alice Kilduff) - /Horticulturae/, 2022, 8(4), 290.

/Featured Paper and Editor's Choice./

/Abstract:/
Willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates help agribusinesses estimate whether a new product is likely to be profitable. For produce, new products, such as new fruit varieties, need to be adopted by producers before they can be sold to consumers. The study of ex ante fruit and vegetable producer preferences is relatively new. This study uses meta-regression analysis to compare the estimated WTP premium between U.S. producers and consumers to determine whether they differ. After controlling for differences in study methods, product attributes, and potential publication bias, the producer WTP was between 14.16 and 27.73 percentage points higher. Subject to several caveats and limitations, this suggests that consumer WTP can be a sufficient metric for the profitability of new produce products.

(with Kevi Mace, Jessica Rudder, Rachael Goodhue, Tor Tolhurst, Hanlin Wei, Elizabeth Grafton-Cardwell, Ian Grettnberger, Houston Wilson, Robert Van Steenwyk, Frank Zalom, and John Steggall) - /Journal of Economic Entomology/, 2022, 115(1), 10--25.

/Outstanding Published Paper which Significantly Contributed to Transdisciplinary Work or Specialty Crop Industries, Specialty Crop Economics Section, Agricultural and Applied Economics Association, 2022./

/Abstract:/
Neonicotinoid insecticides are widely used in agriculture, including in many California specialty crops. With mounting evidence that these insecticides are harmful to bees, state and national governments have increasingly regulated their use. The European Union, Canada, and United States have imposed use restrictions on several neonicotinoids, such as on the timing of applications. In 2020, California proposed a draft regulation to mitigate harm to managed pollinators from four nitroguanidine-substituted neonicotinoids (NGNs): clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam. We use data on California pesticide use from 2015 to 2017 to analyze the economic and pest management implications of the 2020 draft proposed regulation for seven crops: almond, cherry, citrus, cotton, grape, strawberry, and tomato. From 2015 to 2017, these crops accounted for approximately 85% of total hectares treated with NGNs and 87% of NGN use by kilograms of active ingredient applied in treatments that would have been affected by the proposed regulation. These insecticides often primarily target Hemipteran insect pests. In most cases there are alternatives; however, these are often more expensive per hectare and do not have the same residual effectiveness as the NGNs, which are systemic insecticides. Overall, we estimate that pest management costs for these crops would have increased an estimated $13.6 million in 2015, $12.8 million in 2016, and $11.1 million in 2017 if the 2020 draft proposed regulation had been in effect, representing a 61% to 72% increase in the cost of managing the target pests.
