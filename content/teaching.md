My teaching experience stretches back to the second year of my undergraduate program. As a graduate student instructor (TA) at Berkeley, I received an Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor award, a Certificate of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education, and was invited to train new quantitative social science GSIs at a pre-semester, campus-wide teaching conference. As an undergraduate I served for three years as a Peer Assisted Study Session Facilitator (similar to TA) for introductory micro- and macroeconomics, during which time I received a 'Most Valuable Facilitator' award and helped develop a new anti-plagiarism module, the results of which I presented at a national conference. I will be pleased to provide a teaching portfolio, including a statement of teaching philosophy and student reviews, upon request. I currently teach masters-level microeconomics at NC State.
