### Assistant Professor and Extension Specialist

<br>

<!-- UNDER CONSTRUCTION -->

<!-- <div style="text-align: justify"> -->

I am an assistant professor and extension specialist in the [Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at North Carolina State University](https://cals.ncsu.edu/agricultural-and-resource-economics). My work is focused on the economics of specialty crops and the economics of agricultural policy more generally. Applications have included analyzing agro-environmental policy, market analysis, minimizing costs of processing supply chains, and optimizing orchard replacement. 

I hold a Ph.D. and M.S. in agricultural and resource economics from the [University of California, Berkeley](https://are.berkeley.edu) as well as a Bachelor of Resource Economics (Hons. 1M) from the [University of Sydney, Australia](http://sydney.edu.au). During my postdoctoral studies at the [Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Davis](https://are.ucdavis.edu), I co-authored several inter-disciplinary reports for the California Department of Food and Agriculture analyzing the expected impacts of proposed pesticide regulations.

My primary fields of study are agricultural, environmental, and natural resource economics.
