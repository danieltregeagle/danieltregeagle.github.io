### Post-Doctoral Scholar

<br>

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

<!-- I am a post-doctoral scholar in the [Deparment of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Davis](https://are.ucdavis.edu), where I: -->

<!-- * study economic models of perennial crop production. -->
<!-- * study age-structured agricultural capital models. -->
<!-- * apply dynamic models from resource economics to agricultural production and policy issues. [Can I work agroenvironmental policy into this?] -->


<!-- I received my Ph.D. in Agricultural and Resource Economics in 2017 from the [University of California at Berkeley](https://are.berkeley.edu), and received my undergraduate degree in Resource Economics (First Class Honours and University Medal) from the [University of Sydney, Australia](http://sydney.edu.au).  -->

<!-- My primary fields of study are environmental & natural resource economics, and agricultural economics. My dissertation research focused on the economics of perennial crop production, with applications to Brazilian sugarcane in the context of biofuel production. -->

<!-- My current projects include: -->

<!--  * Analyzing the expected costs of proposed Californian pesticide use regulation -->
<!--  * Examining the drivers of boom and bust cycles in perennial crop industries -->
<!--  * Investigating the incentives behind the adoption of marketing orders across agricultural industries driving producer organization fund allocation (how do they spend their money?) -->
<!--  * Crop life cycle affects the incentives for industry collective action -->

<!-- Prior to beginning my Ph.D. I worked at the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics and Science analyzing Australian irrigation policy and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. -->

<!-- [Write up teaching paragraph--perhaps extract from Teaching Portfolio] -->
<!-- I won the Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award -->
<!-- earned and the Certificate of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education UC Berkeley.  -->
