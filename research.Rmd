My dissertation, [The Dynamics of Perennial Crop Production and Processing](https://search.proquest.com/openview/8a0410c763dd2cbd11235ab3588a1050/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), focused on the economics of perennial crop production, with applications to Brazilian sugarcane and the expansion of the Brazilian biofuel industry.

My current projects include:

 * Analyzing the expected costs of proposed Californian pesticide use regulations
 * Examining the drivers of boom and bust cycles in perennial crop industries
 <!-- * Investigating how the incentives for agricultural industry collective action are affected by the life-cycle of the industry's crop -->
 * Investigating how a crop's life-cycle influences growers' decision making, including incentives for collective action and vertical coordination
 
 <!-- driving producer organization fund allocation (how do they spend their money?) -->
 <!-- * Crop life cycle affects the incentives for industry collective action -->

Prior to beginning my Ph.D. I worked at the [Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares) analyzing Australian irrigation policy and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.
