My dissertation, [The Dynamics of Perennial Crop Production and Processing](https://search.proquest.com/openview/8a0410c763dd2cbd11235ab3588a1050/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), focused on the economics of perennial crop production, with applications to Brazilian sugarcane and the expansion of the Brazilian biofuel industry.


## Working Papers

[Optimal Management of Orchards](files/OptimalManagementOfOrchards_200909.pdf) (with Leo Simon)

*Abstract*:
A fundamental issue in perennial crop economics is finding the optimal time to replace trees in an orchard. Orchards have two key characteristics: they consist of trees of multiple vintages, and the trees have a non-monotonic yield curve. We present the first analysis of optimal tree replacement in an orchard that has both characteristics. Our results show that cyclical production is optimal in the long-run, and that optimally managed orchards converge uniformly to the long-run cycle. Our results have implications for orchard valuation, orchard planting, and orchard conversion. We are also the first to provide comparative statics on the long-run cycle radius. 


## Works in progress
 - Identifying how optimizing average crop age can lower biorefinery costs when using perennial feedstocks
 - Valuing improvements in crop traits for *cucurbits*
 - Reviewing methods of measuring economic impact for extension programs
 - Assessing the state of specialty crop supply elasticity estimates (with ZoÃ« Plakias)
